## 💻 Project 

<p > 
  This project is a microservice to send notifications, a service responsible for sending notifications to users or other systems. This service is designed to be   scalable and flexible, allowing different types of notifications to be sent to different communication channels, such as email, SMS, push notifications, among others.
</p>
<p> 
  Notification services are often used in modern applications that require real-time communication with users, such as social networks, messaging applications, e-commerce, task management systems, among others. They can be integrated with other microservices or legacy systems to provide a complete solution for communicating with users.
